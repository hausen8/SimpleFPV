# SimpleFPV

If you need a low cost FPV drone that can be built by almost anyone, here it is. 
This drone can be either 3D printed or simply cut from plywood. It was designed to carry a FPV camera and/or thermal camera like the FLIR Vue.

**3D printed frame:** All files can be found in the STL folder. Depending on the ability of printing supports, there are two versions included:
1) Arm.stl / CP_lower.stl: These arms are easier to print but result in a less stiff frame
2) Arm_2.stl / CP_lower_2.stl: These arms allow a more rigi construction but they require some support that has to be removed after printing
