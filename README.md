# SimpleFPV

If you need a low cost FPV drone that can be built by almost anyone, here it is. 
This drone can be either 3D printed or simply cut from plywood. It was designed to carry a FPV camera and/or thermal camera like the FLIR Vue.

The drone can be equipped with almost any 7" or 8" motor/prop combination. Flight controllers with a 30x30mm hole pattern are recommended but boxed controllers like the old DJI NAZA will fit, too. Bhe battery size and voltage depends on the motors and motor controllers. Flight times up to 15 minutes with a lightweight cam are possible.higher payload will reduce the flight time.

**3D printed frame:**
All files can be found in the STL folder. Depending on the ability of printing supports, there are two options included:
1) Arm.stl / CP_lower.stl: These arms are easier to print but result in a less stiff frame. Good enough for normal flights but not recommended for carrying payload of more than 1000g.
2) Arm_2.stl / CP_lower_2.stl: These arms lead to a more rigid construction but they require some support that has to be removed after printing

**Plywood frame:**
All you need is Plywood-Parts.pdf. Print it with normal paper and stick it on the plywood. Note that depending on the material thickness (3mm or 4mm) there are two different versions of the lower center plate. Instead of making the top platform and the camera platform from two similar pieces that have to be glued to one big piece, you can also make one piece from 5mm or 6mm plywood.

**NOTE:**
Part lists, build manuals and other documents will be added
